Chocosticks is a hobby project of mine that took 2 days to write during the 2nd semester of my Bachelor's Degree in 2005. It started out as a simple scanf-printf program and i kept adding other features. And before i realised the weekend was over. So it lay there forgotten in `C:/TC/`.

Lucky for me i had the habit of backing-up every single thing and then again backing-up the "backups" themselves. Recently i bought a 1TB external hard-drive (1TB=1099511627776bytes, but WD begs to differ) and stumbled across this in the midst of transferring my backups. Unfortunately GAME.exe just did not run anymore. I couldn't believe that chocosticks would not run after so long. Last i checked, programs don't catch mould and rot. Right? :)

After googling for a while i realised that it was my laptop that was to be blamed. I have WinVista running on my laptop now. (Hey dont blame me! it came with the laptop; its a licensed version too!). And M$ has decided to withdraw native-support for 16-bit executables starting WinVista. Thankfully it still continues to work on WinXP which uses [NTVDM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_DOS_machine#NTVDM). So if you are running WinXP then i say go ahead and download [**choco.zip**](https://github.com/TheCodeArtist/chocosticks/raw/master/Misc/choco.zip?raw=true) and give it a try. Detailed steps [**here**](https://github.com/TheCodeArtist/chocosticks/blob/master/Documentation/running-chocosticks.md).

As always there are a [million-ways](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/how-to-run-16-bit-dos-exe-files-in-windows-7/6744ca2a-863b-4229-9fb8-071532d3d998) to work around these seemingly-arbitrary choices M$ tends to take. So for guys and gals running WinVista/Win7/Win8/Win10(its already out there) [DosBox](https://github.com/TheCodeArtist/chocosticks/raw/master/Misc/DOSBox0.74-win32-installer.exe?raw=true) to the rescue. Here is [how to run chocosticks on WinVista/Win7/Win8/Win10](https://github.com/TheCodeArtist/chocosticks/blob/master/Documentation/running-chocosticks.md#3-running-chocosticks-in-dosbox-emulator-on-windows) using DosBox.
