# Introduction

**Chocosticks** is a hobby project of mine that took 2 days to write during the 2nd semester of my Bachelor's Degree in 2005. It started out as a simple scanf-printf program and i kept adding other features. [*Continue Reading >>>*](http://code.google.com/p/chocosticks/wiki/Background)

## Primary Concepts

All this stuff can be found **"in"** the chocosticks code.

- [DOS console graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Graphics_Interface).
- [DOS pc-speaker audio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_speaker).
- Random number generation.
- Motion and bare-basic physics(collision).
- Design-elements of Turn-based strategy games. 

## Secondary skills

Things that one will learn while trying to build and run chocosticks.

- Project management using git: Accessing/Modifying chocosticks code.
- Running legacy-DOS apps in dosbox - [Running **chocosticks** in Dosbox on Windows](http://code.google.com/p/chocosticks/wiki/running_chocosticks#3._Running_chocosticks_in_Dosbox_emulator_on_windows).

# What Next?

## Improving chocosticks
- Fixing a TODO from the bunch of those littered across the code.

## Porting chocosticks to Linux
- Making chocosticks compile using gcc.


# Additional References

1. **[Porting to gcc](http://www.sandroid.org/TurboC)** TurboC-library is a linkable library and a set of C header files that make it easier to port C code originally written for Borland's MS-DOS based Turbo C compiler to GNU gcc.

2. **[Porting to Dev-cpp](http://apcsteacher.com/reference/cpp/dev_cpp_setup.htm)** Thanks to the work of the Russian mathematician and computer scientist Konstantin Knizhnik, and Mark Richardson and Michael Main of the University of Colorado, and recent modifications by Adrian Sandor we now have four wonderful files that enable us to use the graphics commands originally implemented by Borland in their classic IDE/compiler TurboC++.
